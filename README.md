# Fizz Buzz Kata in Scala

## Problem Description

Imagine the scene. You are eleven years old, and in the five minutes before the end of the lesson, your Maths teacher
decides he should make his class more “fun” by introducing a “game”. He explains that he is going to point at each pupil
in turn and ask them to say the next number in sequence, starting from one. The “fun” part is that if the number is
divisible by three, you instead say “Fizz” and if it is divisible by five you say “Buzz”. So now your maths teacher is
pointing at all of your classmates in turn, and they happily shout “one!”, “two!”, “Fizz!”, “four!”, “Buzz!”… until he
very deliberately points at you, fixing you with a steely gaze… time stands still, your mouth dries up, your palms
become sweatier and sweatier until you finally manage to croak “Fizz!”. Doom is avoided, and the pointing finger moves
on.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and
for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz“.

## Stage 2 - new requirements

A number is fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
A number is buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it
For example :

53 should return FizzBuzz (contain 5 and 3)
35 should return FizzBuzzBuzz (contain 3 and 5, and it divided by 5)
